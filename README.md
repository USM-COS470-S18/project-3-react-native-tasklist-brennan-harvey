Project Title: React Native Task List

Instructions:

Here lies the skeleton of what was intended to be a functioning task list app.  The basic structure of a flat list of tasks and add/edit buttons are there, along with a modal overlay to add/edit a task.  A user can click on the Add button or one of the pre-loaded tasks to pop up the modal, but there is zero functionality after that.

Lessons Learned:

I need to spend more time upfront understanding the passing of data from one view to another, and just more time on developing the app in general.  I learned a lot about the React Native framework.  If I spent a little more time with it I think I could really enjoy developing apps with this.  I think it is a brilliant concept and understand why so many apps are built with it.
